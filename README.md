ESPHome component to monitor a Offgridtec Battery Management System via BLE

![Lovelace entities card](lovelace-entities-card.png "Lovelace entities card")

## Supported devices

* Offgridtec LiFePo4 Smart Pro advertised via BLE as `SmartBat-Axxxxx` (e.g. `SmartBat-A12345`)

## Unsupported devices

* Offgridtec LiFePo4 Smart Pro advertised via BLE as `SmartBat-Bxxxxx` (e.g. `SmartBat-B12345`)

## Requirements

* [ESPHome 2024.6.0 or higher](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/releases)
* Generic ESP32 board

## Installation

You can install this component with [ESPHome external components feature](https://esphome.io/components/external_components.html) like this:
```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://syssi/esphome-ogt-bms@main
```

or just use the `esp32-ble-example.yaml` as proof of concept:

```bash
# Install esphome
pip3 install esphome

# Clone this external component
git clone https://github.com/syssi/esphome-ogt-bms.git
cd esphome-ogt-bms

# Create a secrets.yaml containing some setup specific secrets
cat > secrets.yaml <<EOF
bms0_ble_name: MY_BMS_BLE_NAME
bms0_mac_address: MY_BMS_MAC_ADDRESS

wifi_ssid: MY_WIFI_SSID
wifi_password: MY_WIFI_PASSWORD

mqtt_host: MY_MQTT_HOST
mqtt_username: MY_MQTT_USERNAME
mqtt_password: MY_MQTT_PASSWORD
EOF

# Validate the configuration, create a binary, upload it, and start logs
esphome run esp32-ble-example.yaml

```
